# React and TypeScript Quiz Game
A simple quiz game built with React and TypeScript. 

# Why this, what I learned, what I struggled with
This is the first project I've built using TypeScript so there was a lot to learn. It was also good practise with React and I am getting more comfortable with every project.

Hardest part was without a doubt just the basic TypeScript syntax, when to use it and why. But that is also exactly why I decided to build a smaller project first.
